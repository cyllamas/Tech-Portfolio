# Tech Portfolio
I created this repository as my tech portfolio where I can share some of the things I have worked on as a current second year student from Norquest College.

### Edmonton Food Drive Project
This is a group project with two other team mates, Roe Alincastre and Kendrick Kent Moreno. Additionally, this project is in collaboration with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The City of Edmonton, Edmonton Food Bank, and JustServe.Org.

The goal of this project is to improve the operations of the Edmonton Food Drive and maximize the event organizer's resources to yield as much donations as possible. Data was collected from 2023 and 2024 to develop a machine learning model to forecast high performing wards and donation volume.

### Machine Learning Model for Diabetes Detection
A diabetes dataset was used to determine the best performing machine learning model through cross validation. Key variables were identified from the dataset's features and exploratory data analysis was performed to understand the relationship of each feature to one another.

### Oil and Gas Machine Learning Application
This work explores the ways machine learning can be applied to the oil and gas industry and in this instance, machine learning is used for reservoir characterization to produce information about the reservoir's qualities. A facies classier was created to identify the labels of bodies of rocks 

### National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) Substance Release Dashboard
As part of another group project with Roe Alincastre and Kendrick Kent Moreno, an interactive Tableau dashboard was developed to present substance releases of methanol and ethanol based on data from the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI).
